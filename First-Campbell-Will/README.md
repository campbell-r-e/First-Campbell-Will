This project takes user input and then searches for the article on wikipedia and prints to the user the 13 most recent revisions to the page. If there is a network error it will print an error to the user or it will tell the user that the article does not exist on Wikipedia. Also new in this release is that the program can be used using a guid that takes an article name as a string and then finds the changes to the user and print it out to a gui screen for the user. 
To build the project pull it from GitHub repo and then run the CommandController method in the project and the program will run or you can use the new gui by configuring JavaFX on your computer with Gradle by telling grade the main Javafx file is GUIController and then program will run.
